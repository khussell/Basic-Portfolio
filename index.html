                <p class="paragraph1">Hello there! Thank you for visiting my portfolio site where you will learn all about me and my projects! I have always been a very driven person. I always knew what I wanted out of life and would make sure that I would achieve it. My life goals are what keeps me going whether it be travel goals, food goals, or be a better dog-mother goals. My career goals started at a very young age when I decided I wanted to be a dental hygienist. I loved going to have my teeth cleaned as a child and didn't realize that that was not the case for most everyone. I met my goal and became a dental hygienist and have helped people have their best smiles for 6 years. The dental field is very demanding on the body because you are in odd angles all day long trying to see back to those wisdom teeth! Chronic pain and having to touch people in ways they don't want to be touched every 6 months has led me to a career change.</p>
                <p class="paragraph2">I am passionate about creativity, learning, strategy, and logic puzzles. I feed my creativity with home decoration, scrapbooking, and crafts. My obsession with learning has led me to teach myself basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript after work and on weekends. My passion for strategy and logic puzzles is practiced with playing board games and logic puzzles with my friends once a week. These qualities I will use to become the best web developer I can be and to continue to develop new skills as technology advances.</p>
                <p class="paragraph3">Other interests of mine include kayaking, snorkeling, hiking, rock climbing, and relaxing with a drink in my hand on the beach. I am married to a Discovery Cove dolphin Trainer, Kevin, and our child is our treat-beggar, long-napper golden retriever, Lilu. </p>
